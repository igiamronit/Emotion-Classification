 ### File description:
 1. **spectograms**: Contains spectogram of all .wav file in the dataset in the same format as the original Ravdess Dataset
 2. **EpochSpringCamp.ipynb**: Contains all the code with description
 3. **best_model.pth**: Best CNN model
 4. **ravedess_transcript**: Transcripts from the dataset, converted using whisper from OpenAI
 5. **test.csv**, **train.csv**, **valid.csv**: Respective csv files for training, validation and testing.

Note that I am still working on development of RNN and improving CNN and combining both of them to give the final model.
